## 1. Core Web Vitals (20 points)

| Metric | Good | Needs Work | Poor | How to measure |
|--------|------|------------|------|----------------|
| **LCP** (Largest Contentful Paint) | ≤ 2.5s | ≤ 4.0s | > 4.0s | Chrome DevTools `evaluate_script` with PerformanceObserver |
| **FID/INP** (Interaction to Next Paint) | ≤ 200ms | ≤ 500ms | > 500ms | Observe interaction delay on click/type |
| **CLS** (Cumulative Layout Shift) | ≤ 0.1 | ≤ 0.25 | > 0.25 | Visual: content jumps during load? |

**Quick CWV script** (run via `evaluate_script`):
```js
() => {
  const entries = performance.getEntriesByType('navigation');
  const paint = performance.getEntriesByType('paint');
  return {
    domContentLoaded: entries[0]?.domContentLoadedEventEnd,
    loadComplete: entries[0]?.loadEventEnd,
    firstPaint: paint.find(p => p.name === 'first-paint')?.startTime,
    firstContentfulPaint: paint.find(p => p.name === 'first-contentful-paint')?.startTime,
    resourceCount: performance.getEntriesByType('resource').length
  };
}
```

## Scoring

| Range | Grade | Interpretation |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| 90-100 | A | Production-ready, excellent UX |
| 80-89 | B | Good, minor polish needed |
| 70-79 | C | Acceptable, several friction points |
| 60-69 | D | Needs significant work |
| < 60 | F | Major UX issues, not shippable |

## Severity Classification

| Level | Label | Criteria | Action |
|-------|-------|----------|--------|
| **P0** | Blocker | Prevents task completion, a11y violation level A, data loss | Fix immediately |
| **P1** | Major | Significant friction, WCAG AA violation, poor CWV | Fix before release |
| **P2** | Minor | Polish, enhancement, optional improvement | Backlog |
